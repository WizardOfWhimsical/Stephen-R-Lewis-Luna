        <h2>About</h2>
        <div class="essay-format">
            <p>Welcome to my corner of the web. I’m Stephen Lewis — an apiring full-stack web developer with a passion for learning, building, and sharing what I know. Over the past two years, I’ve been diving deep into both front-end and back-end development. Right now, I’m continuing my journey with Code the Dream, where I’ve discovered something unexpected: I love teaching just as much as I love coding.<br/></p>   
            <p>This site is part of that journey — a space where I can give back, grow my skills, and help others who are just stepping into the tech world. Whether you’re stuck on a project, wrestling with a lesson, or just want to talk through your code with someone, I offer walkthrough talking sessions, and coding conversations.<br/></p>                    
            <p>Thanks for stopping by. I’m glad you’re here.</p>
