        <div class="essay-format">
           <h3 class="hiddenForSmallerScreens">Welcome to my corner of the web</h3>
<p>I’m Stephen Lewis — an aspiring full-stack web developer with a passion for learning, building, and sharing what I know. Over the past two years, I’ve been diving deep into both front-end and back-end development. Right now, I’m continuing my journey with Code the Dream, where I’ve discovered something unexpected: I love teaching just as much as I love coding.</p>
<p>This site is part of that journey — a space where I can give back, grow my skills, and help others who are just stepping into the tech world. Whether you’re stuck on a project, wrestling with a lesson, or just want to talk through your code with someone, I offer walkthrough sessions and coding conversations.</p>
<br/><hr><br/>
<strong><em>When I’m not coding…</em></strong>
<p>I stay active — running, walking, exercising daily, and getting outdoors whenever I can. Hiking and camping recharge me, and I balance that with quieter days at home binge-watching a good show or cramming schoolwork. I’m optimistic (sometimes to the point it even annoys me), but it keeps me moving forward.</p>
<p>I’m into disc golf, video games, anime, tabletop and board games. I don’t love reading, but lately I’ve been doing plenty of it to learn and grow. I enjoy exploring new restaurants for their atmosphere as much as their food, and I have a deep appreciation for art — from dark, gothic pieces to the classics you’d find in a museum. Van Gogh will always be a favorite.</p>
<p>As part of The Last Mile alumni community, I value spending time with my brothers, trading perspectives, and building on the lessons we’ve learned together. Networking can feel uncomfortable at times, but the opportunities that come from it are worth grabbing when they appear.</p>
