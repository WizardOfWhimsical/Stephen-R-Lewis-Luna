                Pizza Ranch - Kitchen Leadership and Coordination (Day-to-Day Responsibilities)
When I clock in, the first thing I do is assess everything on the line and in the cooler. I check what’s low, what needs restocking, and what requires immediate attention to keep service running smooth. Once that’s handled, I check in with the on-duty manager to get the rundown on the day — whether there are large parties, staffing changes, or anything that needs extra coordination.
From there, I shift into support mode — helping train new hires or assisting teammates wherever needed. My goal is to make sure everyone has what they need to stay on track and nobody's left guessing what comes next.
Throughout the shift, I’m responsible for keeping the pizza station fully manned. That means making sure all meats, veggies, and dough are prepped and available, and that the line stays stocked and functional from open to close.
<strong>Opening Duties:</strong>
Opening is all about setup and momentum. We pull everything from storage and return it to its station, setting the kitchen up for a smooth flow. The first few hours are spent building what we call the “pizza bank” — a stock of fresh pizzas prepped and ready for the buffet. The pace is fast, and you're constantly replenishing — you don’t stop tossing them in the oven.
<strong>Closing Duties:</strong>
Closing and opening are completely different beasts. At night, we break down the top cooler — transferring meats and veggies into the walk-in to keep them fresh. I prep what’s needed for the next day and make sure the dough count is accurate, adjusting based on expected volume. Before anyone clocks out, I personally check every station to make sure nothing’s been missed. If I’m not the one closing, I check in with the manager to pass along anything they should be aware of for the next shift.
