        hint: JSON.parse(this.response)
    [x] Console.log the value of repositories to better see the data returned from your API fetch
    [x] Save and refresh your browser (or just check your browser for changes if using live extension)
    [x] You should see the list of your GitHub repositories displayed in your console.
    [x] Chain a catch() function to your fetch call to handle errors from the server so the user would know what happened if your Projects section was empty.
        [x] try{}catch{} inside the fetch function. then()catch() on chaining promises

    [] Create a variable names projectSection; using "DOM Selection" to select the projects section by id
    [] Create a variable named projectList; using "DOM Selection" query the projectSection (instead of the entire document) to select the element
    [] Create a for loop to iterate over your repositories Array, starting at index 0
    [] Inside the loop, create a variable named project to make a new list item (li) element
        hint: createElement method
    [] On the next line, set the inner text of your project variable to the current Array element's name property
        hint: access the Array element using bracket notation
    [] On the next line, append the project element to the projectList element
        hint: appendChild method
    [] Save and refresh your browser (or just check your browser for changes if using live extension)
You should see your list of repositories beneath the "Projects" heading on your portfolio site

 Add styling to your projects list, be sure to account for any changes you want in media queries
 STRETCH GOAL: Use flexbox (or grid) to style your list of repositories
By the end of this assignment, you should have a working API fetch to your GitHub account and be able to see a list of your repository names in the Projects section of your portfolio.  Were there to be a server error during the API fetch, your site would return an error message.  Your project list should be styled using flexbos or grid.
